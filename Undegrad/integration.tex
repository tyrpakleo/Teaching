Notes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Q3: this is another way to think about integrals as linear functionals on the vector space of continuous and bounded functions on \(\R^d\). Essentially a measure \(\mu\) allows you to integrate stuff i.e. functions \(f\) with integral \(\int fd\mu\) and the map \(f\to\int fd\mu\) is a linear functional from the set of continuous functions to \(\R\) and is continuous in the sense that if \(f_n\to f\) then \(\int f_nd\mu\to\int fd\mu\) in a sense I will not make precise. The Riesz-Representation theorem gives you the other direction, that linear functionals on continuous functions are just measures.
\end{itemize}
Extra:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Q1: Calculate \(\limsup\) and \(\liminf\) for the following \(a_n\): \(\cos(n),\cos(n^2)\)
    \item Q1: Prove that if \(g\) continuous and increasing then \(g(\limsup{a_n})=\limsup{g(a_n)}\). Prove similarly for \(\liminf\) and \(g\) continuous and decreasing (are the statements the same in that case). Is it enough for \(g\) to be continuous? Increasing?
    
\end{itemize}
